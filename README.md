Project Inspiration
- Our team is tired of searching through the breakfast/lunch/dinner menus of each dining hall to find if our favorite meals are being served
- We wanted to create a web application to solve this problem by creating a more personalized and accessible way to find our favorite meals

Plan
- Use a web scraper to obtain dining hall data (foods being served for breakfast/lunch/dinner)
- Store data in a SQLite database
- Access the data from the front end to display items
- Create searching functionality to find favorite foods

Progress
- Introduced and familiarized team members with Git
- Sucessfully learned and implemented a selenium python script to obtain data
- Successfully stored data in database
- Successfully displayed data on front-end in a CSS styled table

Future Plans
- Modify database to a relational database where "User" would have many "favorite" items
- Implement searching functionality
- Add functionality with Sequelize to add/remove items in the database from the front-end
